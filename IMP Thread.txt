Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time. 
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.


There are two ways to create a thread:
By extending Thread class
By implementing Runnable interface.


Commonly used Constructors of Thread class:
Thread()
Thread(String name)
Thread(Runnable r)
Thread(Runnable r,String name)


DAEMON THREADS 
It provides services to user threads for background supporting tasks. It has no role in life than to serve user threads.
It is a low priority thread.
Its life depends on user threads.
When all the user threads dies, JVM terminates this thread automatically.


GARBAGE COLLECTION 
Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically.
In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.

Advantage of Garbage Collection
It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.
